When working in a Windows environment, we recommend installing WSL first, as it will make subsequent Python development more convenient.

### 1. Install WSL+ubuntu-22.04
Open the windows CMD and type in the command
```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
```
The system will automatically download and install some Linux kernel components.

Next, you‚Äôll see an installation progress bar.

Once it finishes, a prompt will appear asking you to enter a username and password.

Note: When entering your password, nothing will appear in the terminal as you type ‚Äî this is normal behavior.
So, don‚Äôt worry if it looks like nothing is being entered, and avoid pressing keys repeatedly!

`Once the username and password are entered, the setup is complete.`

### 2. Update Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### 3. How to launch WSL after exiting the installer or restarting your computer
Open the CMD and type in the `wsl` command.
```bash
wsl
```

### Why do we need to create a Python Virtual Environment? 
A Python Virtual Environment helps isolate dependencies and prevents the global development environment from becoming messy when working on multiple projects.

1. Install Python3 and Venv(If not already installed)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
```

##  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/28/maintenance.png" width="24"/> Installation and setup the system requirements packages
### 1. Clone the repository
First,Open the CMD and type in the `wsl`.

Then, enter the following command after WSL starts:
```bash
git clone --branch main https://github.com/foxtron-ev/foxtronpi-pyclient
```

### 2. Enter the project folder
```bash
cd foxtronpi-pyclient
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment folder called Pi(You may choose a different name)
```bash
python3 -m venv Pi
```

### 4. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source Pi/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install the package requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 6. Install cryptography
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Read the status of vehicle signals
```bash
python3 read.py
```

### Write the vehicle Control parameter
```bash
python3 write.py
```

Open VS code to develop Python code if you want, but make sure you are inside the `foxtronpi-pyclient` folder.
```bash
code .
